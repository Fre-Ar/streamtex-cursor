# Cursor Rules Organization

This directory contains organized cursor rules for different aspects of the project.

## Structure

```
.cursor/rules/
├── README.mdc (this file)
├── file-extension-standards.mdc
├── streamtex/
│   └── streamtex-project-rules.mdc
└── [future-categories]/
    └── [specific-rule-files].mdc
```

## Usage

The main `.cursorrules` file references these specific rule files using relative paths. This allows for:

- **Modularity**: Each category of rules is in its own file
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update specific rule sets without affecting others
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new rule categories as the project grows
- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns between different types of rules

## Adding New Rules

1. Create a new subdirectory for your rule category (e.g., `python/`, `testing/`, `deployment/`)
2. Add your rule files with descriptive names
3. Update the main `.cursorrules` file to reference the new rules
4. Update this README to document the new category

## Current Categories

- **streamtex/**: Project-specific rules for the StreamTeX framework
  - `streamtex-project-rules.mdc`: Complete set of StreamTeX development guidelines

## File Extension Standards

- **All rule files must use the `.mdc` extension**
- See: [file-extension-standards.mdc](file-extension-standards.mdc) for details
