# StreamTeX Visual Reconstruction Workflow

## 0. Strict Compliance (Read First)
**CRITICAL:** You are reconstructing a visual design using **StreamTeX Primitives**, NOT raw HTML/CSS.
- Adhere to `.cursor/rules/streamtex/streamtex-development.mdc`.
- **Do not** write `st.markdown("<div style...>")` to replicate the look. You must find the correct `sx` function and `Style` combination.

## 1. Context
This workflow applies when the user provides one or more screenshots/images to recreate as a StreamTeX block.

## 2. Visual Audit Strategy
Before coding, analyze the image (all the UI components you see, their text and approximate layout):

### A. Layout & Grid Detection
- **Horizontal Split:** If elements are side-by-side, use `sx.st_grid()`.
    - *Estimate Ratios:* 1/3 Image + 2/3 Text = `cols=[1, 2]` or `cols=3`.
- **Vertical Rhythm:** Identify the main sections (Hero, Content, Footer).

### B. Typography & Hierarchy
- Map visual sizes to styles (e.g., `s.huge`, `s.Large`, `s.large`, `s.medium`, `s.small`, etc.)
- **Color Extraction:** Match colors to `s.project.colors.*` or define new generic colors.
- *Constraint:* Ensure colors are dark-mode friendly (check contrast).

### C. Spacing & Alignment
- **Vertical Spacing:** Use `sx.st_space("v", size=...)` to match the exact vertical gaps seen in the screenshot.
- **Padding:** If text isn't touching the container edge, add `s.container.paddings.*`.
- **Centering:** If text is centered, use `s.center_txt`.

## 3. Implementation Rules

### A. Asset Handling & Naming
If the screenshot contains images, illustrations, or icons, you MUST use `sx.st_image` with the following URI naming convention:
- **Format:** `[current_block_filename_no_ext]_image_[00index].png`
- **Example:** If creating `bck_agent_building_workflow_summary_002.py`, the first image is:
  `uri="bck_agent_building_workflow_summary_002_image_001.png"`
- **Note:** Do not use placeholder names like "placeholder.png" or "image1.jpg". Use the strict schema derived from the block's filename.
- **Description:** Add a comment describing the required asset.

### B. Multiple Image Inputs
- If provided with multiple screenshots (e.g., a scrolling capture split into parts), you must create a **single block** that includes ALL elements from ALL images in their correct sequence.
- Do not create separate blocks unless explicitly asked. Merge the visual flow into one continuous `html_block` or `build_panel` function.

### C. Text Layout
- Use `sx.st_br()` to force line breaks exactly where they appear in the image to preserve the visual shape of the text.

### D. Iterative Styling
- Define `BlockStyles` first.
- Reuse generic styles (e.g., `card_container`) for repeating elements.

## 4. Reconstruction Checklist
- [ ] Is the layout built with `st_grid`/`st_block` (not raw HTML)?
- [ ] Are image URIs named correctly (e.g., `..._image_001.png`)?
- [ ] Does the block contain the full sequence from all provided screenshots?
- [ ] Is vertical spacing respected using `st_space`?
- [ ] - [ ] Are line breaks (`st_br`) used to match the text flow?
- [ ] Are generic styles defined in `BlockStyles`?
- [ ] Is the code free of inline CSS strings?
